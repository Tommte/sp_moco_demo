# Motion compensation on the single pixel camera
This is a demo repository for my work about motion compensation on the single pixel camera. 

## Get to work 
Two scripts (static.py and dynamic.py) are available for the user to get used to the static and the dynamic problems. The scripts simulates synthetic data to work with.

### Dependencies
This demo relies on the scikit-image and the openspyrit packages. You can install them with :
```commandline
pip install scikit-image
pip install spyrit
```


## Additional content
More of my work on motion compensation for the single pixel camera can be found in another repository of mine, but be advised that it is a developing repository so reading it might be difficult.
